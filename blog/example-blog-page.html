                    The first thing I quickly <em>decided</em> on was the fact that I wanted to use the classic Suzanne model in blender as the focus was the effect and not the modelling. Secondly I knew that I wanted the material to make it look like a jewel and luckily I had the perfect HDRI image for creating this effect courtesy of <a href=http://ict.debevec.org/~debevec/Probes/>link also here</a> (I used the Grace Cathedral <a href=http://ict.debevec.org/~debevec/Probes/>and here</a>).

                    I then went into the <em>render</em> <strong>settings</strong> section of the particles tab (I applied a particle system to a sphere) and chose 'Group' and plugged in the name of the group of custom shards I had made, I also checked 'Pick Random' (shown right).
                </p>
                <p>
                    What these settings do, for those that perhaps haven't used them before is to replace every particle emitted with a piece of geometry from the group we just plugged in. 'Pick Random' simply says to randomly choose 1 of the pieces of geometry from the group when emitting a particle. I also turned off the emitter check box which is also in the screen shot to the right to make sure that the sphere that the particle system was applied to didn't show up when rendering.
