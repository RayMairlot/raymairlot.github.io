                    This is what it looks like in the viewport; cards are instanced on curves which are instanced along lines, which are instanced along the x axis, so that the cards can appear in front of each other when looking through the camera.

                    During the Coronavirus lockdown I've been trying to improve my understanding of procedural materials in Blender. During one of my experiments I remembered a video I had seen by the excellent Daniel Shiffman on the <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEyTZ5ZZxZs&vl>Coding Train YouTube channel</a> about '<a href=https://10print.org/>10 Print</a>' and I wondered if I could recreate this in Blender.

                    I recently made my first foray in learning probably one of the most advanced Blender add-ons that exists: Animation Nodes (AN onwards). And by 'learning' I mean I've done one project in it and don't know when I'll do another.[...]
                    Here is my first, and possibly last, test:

                    I released a new video on youtube last week (inspired by <a href=https://vimeo.com/99970136>this</a>), the first in nearly a year. I think I can safely say it went down rather well, getting featured on <a href=http://www.blendernation.com/2015/02/12/lego-fluid-effect/>BlenderNation</a>, which helped it gain 10,000 views in just a few days.[...]
                    As usual, this project went on longer than I wanted, growing from an idea of just showing the actual fluid part to deciding that it needed some <em>context</em>, meaning I felt I should add some type of scene, rather than just some bricks in blank space. I thought I should at least show the bricks appearing (I managed to resist having a submarine surface, I'll leave that for another day ;) ), and to have them appearing <em>from</em> somewhere I added a brick pile.

                    Well the weeks have rolled on since my last video and finally the new effect is finished. This took a while...[...]
                    This video will eventually lead to my first tutorial really that focuses solely on python in blender. The script I wrote can basically take a few parameters such as the grid size, the number of moves (to mix the puzzle, the more the better/slower) and the number of frames each move should take.

                    Introducing my latest effect, Inflating Text:[...]
                    So this effect was a real tough one, it was really difficult at times to get it finished. I had to switch techniques after having worked on it for a few days and had already given up on several other effects when I realised they wouldn't work, so it felt like it took a long time to complete.

                    I've put the <a href=categories/rollercoaster.html>rollercoaster project</a> on hold for a bit. I did a bit of work on it the other day, which I'll talk about in a separate post, and I might work on it as a break from the current project but I just feel I should be focusing on work for my showreel.[...]
                    While the rollercoaster project is something that will be included in my reel it's a bit more general than my modelling 'remit'.  Sure, it has modelling, but it's focus is vfx which is a bit more general. I've always heard you should be quite specific in your reel and that it should clearly represent what you want to do so I'm working on a more modelling heavy project. I'm not going to talk about it at the moment, for some reason I like to keep most of my projects secret, as if I've got a huge audience waiting in suspense. But I'll do a few posts once it's out, it's a complex project (for me) so that may be a while.
