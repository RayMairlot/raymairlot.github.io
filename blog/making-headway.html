                    Despite promising to cover some of the modelling processes I use for the 'Heartbreaker' project, I'm just doing a short post today. Hard surface modelling techniques can wait until I have time (and/or inclination) to do a proper write up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my ongoing modelling odyssey* the Heartbreaker project continues, today with the 'finishing' of the head. I say 'finishing' as there are still a few things to do, like a few interior panels that lie behind the exterior panels, but essentially I have finished the main modelling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below is the comparison between the old head and the new one. Basically every piece was taken back to a basic stage to be rebuilt or just finished according to some better (or what I believe to be better) reference images.

                    <p><em>*Arguably comparable in terms of epicness to The Odyssey by Homer. Not </em>that<em> Homer, the other one, the non-doughnut eating one. Maybe that's unfair. Who am I to say Homer didn't like doughnuts? Maybe he loved them. Maybe referencing different Homers by their doughnut preference was ill-advised and I simply should have been more specific, or, in reality, maybe there aren't as many similarities between this modelling project and an 8th century, ancient Greek poem as I thought...</em></p>

                    I hope you liked the title of this post: 'Making Headway'. It was a pun, because this post has been about the head I've been modelling <em>and</em> because of the progress or 'headway' I've been making. Puns <em>really</em> do give us the best of both worlds: they're fun <em>and</em> informative.
