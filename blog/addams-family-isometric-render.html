                    Following my <a href='/blog/addams-family-mini-house.html'>previous post</a> where I realised I could extract out some parts of a larger project to make a separate render, this time I extracted the attic scene out of my <a href='/blog/categories/addams-family-house.html'>Addams Family house project</a> to create this isometric render and close-ups:

                    I did have to modify the attic scene quite a lot to match the style of an isometric render - the original attic is a deeper room, which doesn't look right when viewed from an isometric angle, but I think it's worth it to get a little extra something out of a large project which is taking far longer to complete than I originally thought.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, it made me realise that I definitely <em>do</em> want to use these volumetric light beams instead of the more cartoony light beams I had created with Geometry Nodes, that this new cobweb system is probably better than the one I was previously using (it stretches image planes instead of having geometry-based webs), and that using material based masks on the walls to cut holes in them for windows is much better than booleans (I had been on the fence about them, but they work really well).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also made <em>heavy</em> use of light and shadow-linking to allow lights to only affect specific objects. I can't imagine how I would have lit the scene without that relatively new feature.
