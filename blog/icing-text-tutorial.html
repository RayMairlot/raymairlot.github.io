                    So here's my latest tutorial based on the <a href=https://www.raymairlot.co.uk/blog/ice-and-icing>Icing Effect</a> from a few videos back:
                </p>
                <div id="yt-embed-container" class="centre-element">
                    <div class="embedtool">
                        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mvO3C8ug_c4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    There's not a huge amount to say specifically about the techniques demonstrated other than it solely focuses on the creating of the icing and not the materials or rendering, but I talk about that in the video anyway. As often happens, I managed to improve the technique from the original video as I was preparing for the tutorial (more on that in a separate post), which is helpful because I wasn't particularly looking forward to recording this. It was a difficult effect (as they all seem to be) and the technique was particularly hard to develop as there didn't seem to be a definite explanation as to why certain things had to be done, which kind of undermines the point of a tutorial which is to teach.

                    Nevertheless, things did get easier and the overall process, while still difficult, is a lot less difficult than it felt while making it. Good organisation definitely helps, particularly when dealing with a rig with lots of controllers, something I lacked when I was making it...
