                                Between April 2016 and May 2017 I worked on and off as a 3D generalist for film and
                                television production company Bigger Bang on a project for their client, Planet3.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The project was to create a series of educational science films serving as introductions
                                to levels in a game by Planet3, whereby the presenter - an actor filmed on greenscreen -
                                would introduce a scientific topic by interacting with and creating graphics around
                                them, all from the Planet3 Orbiter in orbit around earth.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My role was to assist Nathan Williams (producer and 3D artist on the project) on 25
                                shots for the production, which I was responsible for taking from the provided graphics
                                script up to the final renders using Blender 3D, with each shot focusing on different
                                scientific concepts (often with interaction from the greenscreen actors) such as
                                weather, climate, ecosystems and cells.

                        To begin this project we needed a template file to host all of the shots we would be making.
                        Communicating with Nathan, who liased with the client, I created a ready-to-render file that
                        myself and others on the project could use as a basis for all the shots we worked on, which
                        included the spaceship interior in which all shots are set and a flexible compositing setup.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The template included holograms, animated robots (including two animated by Nathan), working
                        'scientists', flashing sci-fi equipment, ships flying by the window and the panoramic view of
                        Earth. The template also eventually included several custom add-ons for Blender 3D which I wrote
                        to assist in the animation of composited layers and to control the template's animated elements.
                    </p>

                            To explain more complex processes, like the formation of coal or geothermal power plants, we
                            created this 2D diagram style where we show a 'cutaway' of the scene.

                            This wireframe effect was used throughout all the diferent shots for a feeling of visual
                            consistency and also helped with the tight schedule as we were not aiming for realism.

                        Some of the types of effects I had to create were: Chemical reactions; explanations of
                        scientific equipment, such as Doppler radar; weather sensors; tornados; energy flow; geysers;
                        geothermal power; microbes; ocean currents; rain and snow; robot animations; Greenscreen actors
                        interacting with on-screen graphics like spinning globes, screens and graphs; holograms and
                        flocks of birds.

                        The idea was that all the graphical elements appearing around the 'presenter' were holograms
                        that were being created as they were needed, so we drew some of the elements as wireframe
                        objects to enhance the idea that they are computer generated. We took this idea further by using
                        a chromatic aberration effect to give the sense that the holograms were real and therefore
                        susceptible to imperfections.

                            Visual consistency was important to make all the shots feel part of the same series. This
                            was helped by having the same setting for each shot - the Planet3 Orbiter - and continued by
                            having a standardised style for text and text boxes and diagrammatic arrows.
                        </p>

                            Planet3 also advised us on text usesage and fonts to comply with their style-guide.

                        In the main template used for all the shots, the lighting in the ship is baked (precalculated)
                        into the textures, allowing fast render times, even in HD. However, this 'lights-off' version,
                        only needed for part of one shot, required a custom setup to allow the screens and sci-fi panels
                        to illuminate the dark scene which wasn't possible by default. This effect would eventually be
                        contolled with a Python add-on, allowing a checkbox to turn the lights on or off.

                        The challenge of this project was the tight deadline, but we were helped by our initial
                        investment in setting up templates and good defaults for shots, even if some of those defaults,
                        like robot rigs or lighting setups, had to be expanded as the client reacted positively to them
                        and asked more of them than had initially been anticipated.

                        While the schedule was tight, it was great to work on a project that required such a variety of
                        work to be done, from physics simulations, modelling, animation and compositing to Python
                        scripting and the result was a series of consistent shots that were fun to work on and that the
                        client was very happy with.
