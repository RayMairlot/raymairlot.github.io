                                In 2018 I worked as a 3D modeller for animation studio Sandboxx Studio on a project for
                                their client. I am not able to disclose the company, hence the generic name for this
                                case study.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The project was to create assets for a VR training game running in Unity that would be
                                used internally at the company.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My role was to model a maintenance van and some props that would sit in the back of the
                                van. These models were then textured and exported to Unity by Sandboxx. The materials
                                and renders on this page were produced purely for this case study.
                            </p>

                </div>

                <div>
                    <p>
                        The main model that I had to create was a maintenance van. The van would mainly be seen from the
                        back so the interior of the cabin did not have to be modelled. The side and rear doors had to be
                        able to be opened in order to show what was in the van.

                        I also had to render a few props that would go in the van such as: A cable holder and a pump
                        (pictured below), a welly, a cone, a roadworks barrier, road works signs, a wet floor sign and a
                        crate.
