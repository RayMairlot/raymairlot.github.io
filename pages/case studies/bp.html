                                In 2019 I worked as a 3D modeller for animation studio Sandboxx Studio on a project for
                                their client, BP.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The project was to create a video for internal use at the company to train employees on
                                how the BP Loyalty Card scheme works. This was done as a 3D animation, mainly set in and
                                around a 3D BP Petrol Station, but which also included 2D motion graphics.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My role was to help Sandboxx with the modelling of props, vehicles, and both the
                                interior and exterior of the petrol station itself. The modelling of characters and the
                                environment surrounding the petrol station, 2D and 3D animations, shading, and rendering
                                were handled by Sandboxx. I also did basic texturing which involved unwrapping and
                                laying out UVs on an approved colour swatch grid.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The video on the right is a highlight reel, which mainly focuses on scenes that show the
                                modelling I did.

                        The models were created in Blender 3D and then exported to Unity in FBX format where the scenes
                        were animated and rendered. Some layout was done in Blender, but mostly it was assembled once in
                        Unity. The models were kept to a low-poly style with some faces remaining faceted to enhance
                        this style.

                        In addition to the forecourt, I also modelled the shop and cafe and all interior props,
                        which included: food, drinks, shelving, coffee equipment and a cash machine. A basic shell
                        of the building existed when I came onto the project in addition to the till model.

                        The shop was built, designed (based on photos of real BP shops) and laid out in Blender,
                        fitting a grid system to allow easy reassembly of items in Unity.

                        A small part of the animation included a scene set in the 1920s to accompany a voice-over
                        explaining that "customer loyalty used to be simpler". This required the modelling of a 1920s
                        car and garage. Reference images were used in order to construct a realistic, timber frame
                        garage and vintage pumps.

                        Being a petrol station, in addition to the 1920s car, several other vehicles were needed to
                        populate the scenes. This included (from left to right) an SUV, a maintenance van and a slightly
                        more stylised car variant. Originally the animated was going to be a more stylised with slightly
                        exaggerated proportions. In the end this was reduced and the stylised car was replaced with the
                        SUV.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A maintenance van was also used which included a roof mounted cherry picker. I also rigged the
                        cherry picker in order to make sure the hydraulic pistons were of the right proportions to
                        extend correctly.
