                            <p>
                                In 2017 I worked as a 3D generalist for film and television production company Bigger
                                Bang on a small project for their client, Shell.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The project was to create a short animation that would be used internally at Shell to
                                show the process of decommissioning oil rigs in the Brent Oil Field, owned by Shell.
                                Initially, the goal was to also include the Pioneering Spirit, a boat specifically built
                                to carry oil rig platforms, but eventually, this was reduced to just showing the oil
                                rig, a comparison of the oil rig's size compared to landmarks and the basics of how the
                                top of the oil rig platform detaches from the base.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My role was to work directly with director, David Hatter, to take existing assets, model
                                new ones and animate and render them to create a blueprint-style animation. The
                                animation was completed in Blender 3D.

                        I was initially provided with an existing oil rig asset, but I knew such a high
                        resolution model would be both difficult to manage and would probably not work well with
                        the methods I was intending to use to get the blueprint look. Below is a test render
                        that I sent to the director to explain this. Upon seeing this he gave me the go-ahead to
                        spend time heavily reducing the complexity of the model, which resulted in practically
                        all pieces of the oil rig being remodelled with simpler geometry.

                    <p>
                        Below is the finalised look for the blueprint, using the remodelled oil rig. Created in Blender
                        3D, this combined the Blender Internal render engine's wireframe shader for the main geometry
                        detail, Freestyle for the thicker outlines and Cycles for the diffuse shading.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite having the intention to wholly use the Cycles rendering engine for this, combined with
                        Freestyle for the line rendering, even with simplified geometry the render time was too costly
                        to use Freestyle for everything. Instead, Blender's 'Blender Render' engine (Blender Internal)
                        was used for the bulk of the line work and Freestyle was reduced to only doing the outlines of
                        geometry, something that Blender Internal couldn't do and Freestyle could do without extending
                        render times too much. Several render passes from the two render engines and Freestyle were then
                        combined in Blender's compositor to create the finished effect.

                        The first stage of the animation shows a transition between some existing footage of an oil rig
                        and the digital oil rig. The digital oil rig only had to be representative of the real oil rig,
                        so the transition isn't exact.

                        The second stage of the animation was to show the oil rig to scale next to some famous
                        landmarks. I reused the Empire State Building from another project I had done for Bigger Bang
                        and modeled The Eiffel Tower.

                        The final stage of the animation shows the lifting off of the oil rig top from the base, which
